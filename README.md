Power BI report I made analyzing rest periods customers had between certain applications.
Existing data is from a model bank in excell that contains information about individual customers and the applications themselves
SQL was used to extract relevant information from the dataset
Power BI was used to visually present the analysis. it mainly showcases the correlation between average rest months and application types and statuses
