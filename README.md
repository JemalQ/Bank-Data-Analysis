# Bank-data-analysis
Power BI report I made analyzing rest periods customers had between certain applications.
Existing data is from a model bank in excell that contains information about individual customers and the applications themselves.
SQL was used to extract relevant information from the datasetm
Power BI was used to visually present the analysis. it mainly showcases the correlation between average rest months and application types and statuses. I also analyzed the correlation between customer characteristics and rest periods.
Ultimately, I showcased information that i believed was most impactful in increasing or decreasing the amount of rest months customers had between applications.
For the sake of accuracy, I also included a total applications count that put the existing information into context.
